# professorCubo 

## Running on your own

Having a rubik cube nearby, to run our application you simply need python (especially 3.9) and pip to run!
Simply do:

```sh
> git clone [this repo]
> cd professorCubo
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> python app.py
```

And done! The application will be running :)


PS: Beware that the video is not included in this git repository and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M-uvifLalx9URzHbeMDjJYnLZyUlxCoo/view). To make it work inside the app, you need to download it and paste it to the content folder inside the repository, meaning the path of the file must be `professorCubo/content/cubeVideo.mp4`.
